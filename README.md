# YouTube Mobile Application Enhancement Project

## Overview
YouTube is a widely known online video-sharing platform that allows users to publish, watch, and share videos. The YouTube mobile application, available for both iOS and Android, is optimized for smartphones and tablets, providing a user-friendly interface and mobile-specific functionalities. Despite its popularity, one common pain point among users is the inability to run the application in the background while multitasking on their devices.

## Project Vision
This project aims to address the major pain point by developing a new feature that allows YouTube content to run in the background on smartphones. This enhancement will enable users to navigate between screens while listening to audio or watching videos, significantly improving multitasking capabilities.

## Key Features
### Video Progress Memory and Easy Access (VPM)
- **Description**: Allows users to seamlessly resume videos from where they left off, even after switching apps or answering phone calls.
- **Benefit**: Enhances user experience by eliminating the need to manually find the last watched spot.

### Background Audio Playback (BAP)
- **Description**: Enables users to listen to audio from YouTube videos while using other applications.
- **Benefit**: Facilitates multitasking, such as listening to podcasts or music while performing other activities on the smartphone.

### Mini-Screen Mode (MSM)
- **Description**: Provides a small, resizable screen that displays YouTube videos and floats above other apps.
- **Benefit**: Allows continuous video watching while navigating between different applications or performing other tasks.

## Project Components
